So this challenge was a little bit trickier for me than the bank challenge. But here is what I learned...

Data display: For the user to see their tasks, I wanted to display the task info as key-value pairs. Basically what I understand as an object in JavaScript. And then hold that data within an array. Originally I did some research and thought a hashmap and putting them into an array list would be the proper solution for this. So I set that up, but I ran into the issue that once every task was created and put into a hashmap, they would lose the methods that I created in the corresponding classes. I did end up having to use AI to solve this, but what I found was that I could simply override the toString method so that the data would display how I wanted it to, put the tasks into the array list (with a small change to the type of the array list) AND the newly created tasks would still have access to their methods.

Syntax: I think I used an enhanced for loop in the bank challenge, but could not remember the syntax. So I had to look it up. So now I'll remember it's for (DataType item : arrayOrArrayListOfItems). Just like in JavaScript, item can be anything but it should be something relevant to whatever I am looping through. arrayOrArrayListOfItems is the name of whatever set of data I am looping through.
